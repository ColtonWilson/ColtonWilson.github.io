            of classes to take as electives, so I studied for an Applied Mathematics degree while being a member of my school's NCAA  Men's Swim Team. Post-graduation, 
            I took on a role in management. I quickly worked my way to the top and became one of the youngest managers on the west coast. However, something was missing, 
            and I wanted to get back into computer science.  So I have decided to go back to school and pursue my Master's in Computer Science where I have learned C++ 
            and also take some night classes for HTML, and CSS. I continue to learn more and am looking forward to the next Software Engineering role where I can be a 
            part of a team that is building a product to better the world.
